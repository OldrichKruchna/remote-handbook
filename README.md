## Why?

The remote work is not a struggle! It's a benchmark for you project.

## How?
All remote best practices can be used for any kind of work - development, designing, client communication, decision making, management communication. We don't have to reinvent the wheel, there are completely remote companies out there, we can just learn from what they have achieved. But how to implement it to the daily work you ask? Good question. Start with the small steps. We do have define Remote Work Maturity Matrix - a tool which can help you define how are you doing it now, what exactly change to improve the remote work experience even more.

## TL;DR

1) Write it down - and be extra explicit.
2) Focus on the results and not time. Only the work matters.
3) Go asynchronous and have just few synchronous meetings.
4) Meetings are the worst place for sharing information.
5) Small steps - "If you take a small step, you don’t have to involve a lot of people because you’re not going to be very far away from what everyone else is. If you take a small step, you’ll get the feedback after that so you don’t need to unfold all kinds of scenarios."
6) Fast decisions - Everyone can express an opinion, but you don’t have to convince everyone, you don’t need to get consensus to put something into action. That take times; forever." (https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/resources/)
6) Responsibility - Who wants what? Who is responsible for it?

## Meetings

### TL;DR

- What the meeting is about?
- What is expected output?
- Who is involved? Do you know everyone, what's their role in the meeting?
- What the next steps?
- Who is responsible for the next steps?
- When the steps will be done? 

### Detail matters
With a few detail you can get as close as possible to face to face communication:

- The most important is that people are able to interact on the same inputs. That means do always share screening if you talk about something specific.
- The meetings are easier if all the attendees have similar conditions, so if everyone sits in front of their own computed. That helps from one-to-many meetings.
- In case you have the one-to-many meeting, introduce everyone and clarify their role in the meeting.
- Meeting is the worst place where to share things. So write down after each meeting what/who/when.
- Invest more time to communication than usually. Introduce new people, say shortly what is your background, spend more time than usual, because communication windows is smaller than in the real life. Show colleagues your office, share you context and background.

## For people who work in the same office

- All communication should be via meetings where all stakeholders are present
- Everything should be written down in the tickets
- Avoid of sharing just with your local colleagues, communication is important yes, but write it down after you talk 

## How to enhance remote work

1. Let the whole team to work remotely, especially PO/PM
2. Try it at least for few weeks or few days per week
3. Evaluate results

## Meet in person

- People have to be able meet whenever they feel it's right. The budget has to count with that, that's part of remote work.

## Tools

- Remote retro (https://remoteretro.io) - use remote tools, the blackboard doesn't work for remote.
- Jabra - use good equipment, to reduce odd feeling from remote communication.
- Ethernet cabel - the good internet is crucial of course. You can prevent yourself and your team member from unnecessary frustration, so don't call from train or bus.
InVision - let's all the stakeholders
