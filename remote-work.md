## Meetings

- "Meeting is the worst place where to share things." -> Write down after each meeting what/who/when // TODO do quotes
- "The most important is that people are able to interact on the same inputs"
- "Best when all people are join through own computer", to prevent one-to-many meeting
- Introduction of all people involved in the meeting room, sometimes is not clear who is who.
- Introduce new people, say shortly what is your background, spend more time than usual, because communication windows is smaller than in the real life. Show collegues your office, share you context and background.

### General meeting rules

- Define who

## For people who work in the same office

- All communication should be via meetings where all stakeholders are present
- Everything should be written down in the tickets
- Avoid of sharing just with your local colleagues, communication is important yes, but write it down after you talk 

## How to enhance remote work

- Let the whole team to work remotely, especially PO/PM
- Try it at least for few weeks
- Evaluate results

## Meet in person

- People have to be able meet whenever they need. The budget has to count with that. It can't happen that people don't meet when they need to because of the budget constrains. You took advantage of the remote work, but you have to also be able to pay back when needed.
